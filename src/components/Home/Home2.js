                Since High school, I've always been interested 
                in Mathematics and Competitive Programming - even participated in a couple 
                of Online and In-person contests ðŸ¤“
                <br />
                <br /> My first languages are 
                <i>
                  <b className="purple"> C++, C, Python, Java (A bit of this) in respective order. </b>
                </i>
                <br/>
                As you've guessed, those are the popular languages used in Competitive Programming. 

                <br />
                <br />
                I kind of got bored of competitive programming, for a while, since I wasn't building actual stuffs. 
                So I decided to take up Data Science/ML/AI since It's closely related to my interest in Maths and optimization in general. 
                <br/>
                My current field of Interests are &nbsp;
                <i>
                  <b className="green">AI/ML, game development, Software Engineering (Backend development). </b> and
                  also {" "}

                In my Sophomore year, I spent my Fall semester in South Korea. My time there was filled with a lot of experiences including going to the famous Gangnam style pose sculpture, having local barbecues with friends - those made at school and also at Korea. 
                Other wonderful moments include trying the lcoal dishes like Tteokbokki, Kimchi Stew, Jjajangmyeon, and every type of noodles. I also got to visit the Seoul Upcycling Plaza, where used products or objects were recycled to things of higher values.
