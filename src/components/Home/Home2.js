              <p className="home-about-body">
                Right from High school, I've always been interested 
                in Mathematics and Competitive Programming. Even Participated in a couple 
                of Online and In-person contests ðŸ¤“
                <br />
                <br /> My first languages are 
                <i>
                  <b className="purple"> C++, C, Python, Java (A bit of this) in respective order. </b>
                </i>
                <br/>
                As you've guessed, those are the popular languages used in Competitive Programming. 

                <br />
                <br />
                I kind of got bored of competitive programming, for a while, since I wasn't building actual stuffs. 
                So I decided to take up Data Science/ML/AI, since It's closely related to my interest in Maths and optimization in general. 
                <br/>
                My current field of Interest's are &nbsp;
                <i>
                  <b className="green">AI/ML, game development, Software Engineering (Backend development). </b> and
                  also {" "}
                  <b className="purple">
                    Competitive Programming (active mainly on Leetcode).
                  </b>
                </i>
